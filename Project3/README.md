## prototyping
in the beginning, I tried to use the pressing sensor for detection. Then I realized I needed to hit the pressing sensor to get data, it is not very convenient for ball detection.
So I switched it to the light sensor, I use an LED in front and a light sensor in the back so when the ball enter the space, the light sensor would detect the light decreasing.

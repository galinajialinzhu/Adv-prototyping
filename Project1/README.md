# WEEK4
## part 1
This week, we started to do the prototype part for it. I chose the plush toy idea and meshed it with one of the anime characters --Bill Cipher.

First, I designed the diagram for the plush-- how will the user interact with this plush?

Then I start coding them in UIflow. However, I get the bug that the button cannot be clicked twice. So one of the functions is not working... I changed some code that I deleted that part in the diagram and re-coding them and make the other part work.

After the coding part is working, I will focus on the wiring part. I have two solutions for this project, one is using the esp32 original light, and the other is using color rings. I am not sure how to combine the ring in esp32 right now so I just made the [solution 1 prototype](../code_oct6_0500.m5f2)) work.

## question
1. debug the button problem
2. Using color rings problem

## solution
1. fixing it by using the button as a pin instead of using UIflow BtnA.<img width="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/galinajialinzhu/Adv-prototyping/assets/92561657/d63845da-e1dc-46c9-8031-c5e73ecdfff5">
